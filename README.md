Dashboard Implementation
Figma Design Integration
Figma Design Link: Figma Design
Download the Figma design file from the provided link.
Implement the dashboard layout based on the design.
Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.
Card Population
The dashboard contains multiple cards.
Populate each card with random images obtained from the Lorem Picsum API.
2: API Integration
API for Random Images
API Endpoint: Lorem Picsum API
Use the API to fetch random images for populating the cards.
The API returns a JSON array of image details, including URLs.
Handle errors gracefully.
Task 3: CRUD Operations
Create Operation
Implement the ability to add new cards to the dashboard.
Include a form or modal for users to input necessary information.
Validate and add the new card to the dashboard.
Read Operation
Enable users to view details of each card by clicking on it.
Display additional information on a separate modal or panel.
Update Operation
Allow users to edit the content of existing cards.
Implement a form or inline editing for easy modification.
Delete Operation
Provide the functionality to delete a card from the dashboard.
Implement a confirmation dialogue before deletion.
Task 4: Deployment
Deploy the Frontend
Deploy the frontend of your dashboard to a cloud platform of your choice (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, or any other).
Ensure that the deployed version is accessible via a public URL.
Optional Backend Deployment (if implemented)
If you have implemented a backend (with or without a database), you can choose to deploy it as well.
Provide clear instructions on how to deploy and interact with the backend, if applicable.
If not deploying the backend, ensure that the frontend functions seamlessly with the mock data or API.
